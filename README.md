# Eloi Lab WoW Addon  

A laboratory of Lua code in an addon for World of Warcraft to experiment with extracting game data.  

This addon contains two main components:  
- Code to extract data from the game for bot creation.  
- Code to collect and stack information on bots you encounter, allowing you to report them via QR codes, color coding, or copy-paste methods.  

### Goals:  
- I am a white hat; I do this purely for fun and educational purposes.  
  - My aim is to allow young developers to learn coding by creating bots in WoW.  
  - To teach aspiring anti-bot developers how to fight bots using bots.  

### Installation:  
1. Navigate to:  
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`  
2. Run:  
   ```sh
   
   git clone https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_01_18_EloiLabWowAddon.git "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\EloiLab"
   git clone https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_01_18_EloiLabWowAddon.git "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\EloiLab"
   ```  
3. This works for both retail and classic hardcore modes. (Ping me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WnmXsXHbSn) if something is broken.)
